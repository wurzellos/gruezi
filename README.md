DNS-Based Service Discovery

* DNS based (unbound) - https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/
* IPv6 support
* CLI for checking members
* Discovery bootstrap (URL) option


## Why? 

We need something that fully supports IPv6, Consul is a very nice project but doesn't support IPv6 (https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/11847)
